## What is Mikrom?
Mikrom is inspired by [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper), a popular micro ORM for .NET.

## Philosophy
- No automated tracking of changes
- No reflection-based mapping
- Provide convenient DSLs, so the explicitness doesn't become tedious
- Explicit transaction management is mandatory
- Multiplatform design, with JDBC and R2DBC (to-be-added) support added by separate modules.
  - JS and Native variants not currently planned, raise an issue if you want them.

I want to provide a simple way of working with databases, that does _not_ involve automatic change tracking in "entities".
I want explicit control over what is being updated, and how. With Mikrom, you are in control and can write SQL that fits your exact needs.

Command-query separation becomes natural, since there is no relationship between reading and writing data tied to some "entity" class.

## Usage
> Note: This library is in the concept stage. The API is highly likely to change, and the compiler plugin is work in progress.

### JDBC
Create a JDBC connection and construct a `Mikrom` instance:

```kotlin
val dbConnection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:your_database_url")
val jdbcDataSource = JdbcDataSource(dbConnection)

data class Book(val author: String, val title: String, val numberOfPages: Int)

val mikrom = Mikrom {
  registerMapper { row ->
    Book(
      author = row["author"] as String,
      title = row["title"] as String,
      numberOfPages = row["number_of_pages"] as Int
    )
  }
}

// Compilation error, `execute` is only defined in the context of a transaction.
mikrom.execute(
  Query("INSERT INTO books (author, title, number_of_pages) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"),
  listOf("JRR Tolkien", "The Hobbit", 310),
  listOf("George Orwell", "1984", 328),
)

dataSource.transaction {
  mikrom.execute(
    Query("INSERT INTO books (author, title, number_of_pages) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"),
    listOf("JRR Tolkien", "The Hobbit", 310),
    listOf("George Orwell", "1984", 328),
  )

  mikrom.queryFor<Book>(Query("SELECT * FROM books")) shouldBe
    listOf(
      Book("JRR Tolkien", "The Hobbit", 310),
      Book("George Orwell", "1984", 328),
    )

  mikrom.queryFor<Book>(Query("SELECT * FROM books WHERE number_of_pages > ?"), 320) shouldBe
    listOf(Book("George Orwell", "1984", 328))

  // The transaction scope must result in either Commit or Rollback.
  // If the block exits by throwing an exception, it will automatically roll back.
  TransactionResult.Commit
}
```

### Parameter mappers
Building on our previous example, lets say we want structured Query types. We can leverage ParameterMappers to achieve this.

```kotlin
data class SearchBooksByNumberOfPages(val minPages: Int)

val mikrom = Mikrom {
  registerParameterMapper<SearchBooksByNumberOfPages> { request ->
    mapOf("minPages" to request.minPages)
  }
}

dataSource.transaction {
  mikrom.queryFor<Book>(
    Query("SELECT * FROM books WHERE number_of_pages > :minPages"),
    SearchBooksbyNumberOfPages(320),
  ) shouldBe listOf(Book("George Orwell", "1984", 328))
}
```

### Compiler plugin
Using the compiler plugin, you can annotate your data classes with `@RowMapped` to automatically generate row mappers.

```kotlin
// This will automatically generate a `RowMapper<Book>` implementation and register it with Mikrom.
@RowMapped
data class Book(val author: String, val title: String, val numberOfPages: Int)
```
